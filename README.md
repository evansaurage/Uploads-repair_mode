# Uploads-repair_mode
These were uploaded and taken on my pixel 9a. Anyone else familiar with this?

context
im in repair mode, swipe down an noticed my device says its managed. thus is unexpected as i do not have a job this is a new phone that i qas told was bought from spectrum in store. i click on policies and notice that it immediately tries to hide something. so i keep accessing the same area trying to screen shot it. says the corporation had been changing my location. 

i check a few other areas i noticed everything i uploaded.... so yeah, its strange because this also happened on my iphone. suspicion drove me to make a buisness account with a new email at someone elses house then make a buisness account purely for trying to enroll my own iCloud email. well i couldnt, twas already enrolled in someone elses organization. and ot happened on my samsung z flip, and it happened on my motorola all were either bought from the store given to me as gifts. and i havent had a job, nor ever consented to any enrollments befor.

its persistent have yet to find a solution though i noticed im not allowed to update the play store version, and it hides (atleast it tries to) i usually end up finding, but im never able to resolve the issue theres no way to contact this mystery admin, maybe someone can help? ive filed police reports for harassment and a few other related issues its driving me nuts. sometimes it locks my phone while im using it "this device was locked by your it admin" whike using the Motorola, on the pixel itll say something similar,

i have my suspicions but i wont say on here as their mainly based off loads of technical anomalies since about novemeber 2025 and various personal circumstances. 

please help this have been ongoing its taking its toll on my personal life its isolated me. 

when i chat with ai looking back i think it may even be gas lighting me (though it could be chatgpt being a faker who knows lol) what ever it is it feels personal. the timing and the errors and the anomalies and the responses or the lack there of westher from friends family weather i have to reset my device today whatver, i just know befor a certain time in my life i never say the microphone indicator turn on i had a long google timeline history and contacts in my phone. now all of thats gone, ive lost contact with so many people ive wasted so much time and effort on trying to remove the issue, its upsetting. i feel harassed /: 

ive known since about march but it wasnt accompied by anything other then device symptoms. the enrollment diagnosis matches everything ive experienced. last month i was able to find this in repair mode. to be able to prove it visually. oddly enough my birth certificate and drivers license went missing around the exact same time periods within the same month (novemberish) around the same group of people and this is when i started experiencing the symptoms. device locks, calling issues, not recoveing texts, battery drain, camera and mic indicator coming on, getting logged out of my accounts, not having access to networks the list goes on. if youd can help thats be appreciated.
